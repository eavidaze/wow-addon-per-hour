# Per Hour

Do you want to know your performance? The Per Hour Addon is for you!

You will be able to measure your performance:

- Experience.
- Honor.
- Reputation.

  - A reputation must be selected to be displayed as Experience Bar.

    - `Character Info` window > `Reputation` tab > click in a reputation > check `Show as Experience Bar`.

  - If you change your reputation selected, the tracker will be reseted.

I'll soon add many other measurement options, such as:

- Gold.
- Etc.

This is an experimental project and feedbacks are welcome!
